# Issues Explorer (front end)

**ðŸ‘‹ Please read all of the instructions before you begin**

> Please feel free to ask questions!

First and foremost, this project is meant for you to showcase what you can do with JavaScript and CSS.

We want to gauge your grasp of Javascript app development, CSS techniques (pre/post-processors are welcome), and how you organize your code. We'll be looking for best practices, your development process, design decisions, and overall project structure.

## M-V-P! M-V-P!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a prototype of a cool issue explorer for a fictional client. As an initial goal, you'll be creating the issue explorer for GitHub issues and those issues will be filterable by their state!

We are giving _you_ complete control over the architecture of how to implement it. If you're curious, our internal stack at the moment is React, Apollo, and CSS Modulesâ€”however, as an engineering team we believe in using the right tool for the job so feel free to use _your_ best tools to complete the assignment.

[**Check out the wireframes on Figma**](https://www.figma.com/file/U0OD0zrNbtLHJuRjkS1Wpn/Github-Issue-Explorer) to get a clear picture of the task. (You'll need to make a Figma account to inspect) ðŸ˜Ž

### Constraints

- It must look and feel good across **all** screen sizes
- That's it!

### Tasks

- Create a `README.md` file with simple instructions to run the app
- Create a search page with a search bar. Users should be able to paste a GitHub repo URL here
- Create a results page that displays **all** (open, closed, pull requests) issues from the search query
- Indicate which issues are closed or pull requests using the icons
- Implement filtering by open, closed, or pull requests on the results page
- Add loading, empty, and error states
- _Consider your user: Feel free to use the wireframes as the design but don't be afraid to add styling (especially if it enhances usability)_

## Hints

- It is an MVP (minimum viable product) - done is better than perfect
- Please wrap up the coding portion of this assignment within 4 hours. If you need some extra time to plan, research, and fill in the "Looking Back" section of your Q&A, take it. If you don't complete some tasks, there's an opportunity to talk about them in the "Looking Back" section.
- Test your app with repos that are [full of issues](https://github.com/facebook/react) as well as ones that have [no issues](https://github.com/axiomzen/cc_IssuesExplorerFE_Empty)
- Use the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference) as your source of data
- _Be aware of [the API's pagination params](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination)_

**Before you start, please read and fill out the "Planning" section of the [QnA.md](./QnA.md)**.

That's all for now. Don't hesitate to ask questions, for guidance or for more clarification on the project. We are excited to see what you come up with!

Good luck!
