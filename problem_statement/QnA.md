# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

Mainly two risks need to be taken care of while completing this project -
- Scalability Risk - Since the aim is to build a generic issues explorer, the architecture should not be tightly bound to Github, and it should be easy to plug in other clients in the future.
- Design consistency - Chosen CSS frameworks and tools should be standardized and developer-friendly so that whoever picks up the project in the future can continue the work instead of re-writing parts of the code.


> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

I would want to make few improvements to the current design -
- Empower users to search & filter issues using more parameters like labels, owner, assignee, etc.
- Add a different way of viewing filters for better exploration, like adding a list view along with the grid view.
- If GitHub API permits, make the filters more useful for users by adding stats with the filters' values. For instance, open issues (10), closed issues (23), etc.


> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

Few features that will add a significant value to the project are -
- Allow users to interact & update the issues in the UI directly instead of redirecting to the client.
- Create Issues Analytics dashboard to give the ability to see how the team is performing.
- Allow users to group issues by category for easier discovery - by teams, projects, milestones, etc.

Some other features include, in no particular order -
- Allow users to favorite/bookmark an issue for quicker access.
- Add authentication & authorization flows to allow users to save the bookmarks and the repos list.
- Add shortcuts and a global command line to explore & triage issues faster.
- Add integrations with other clients like BitBucket & GitLab to allow users to view issues from multiple clients at one place.
- Create public APIs for the product to empower users to build custom third-party workflows.
- Create a new "roadmap" view type so that users can plan better.

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

-

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

-

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

-

> Did you learn anything new?

-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

-

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
